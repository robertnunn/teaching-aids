Collection of documents I used to help students practice math problems and understand concepts

Chi-square: Randomly generates population data for students to practice the chi-square calculations on mono-genic, bi-allelic traits to determine if the population is evolving or not.

Plating: Randomly generates plating problems in one of four variations. Each variation has a different set of two variable unknown with the remaining three being given to the student. Context is plating a microbial culture after diluting it and counting colonies produced.

Dating: Randomly generates radiometric dating problems using a variety of decay pairs. Students have to determine how old an object is based on how much of each element is present.

Dilution: Randomly generates serial dilution problems, where students have to detemine the final dilution factor given a set of stock/diluent volumes.

Carrying Capacity: Python (3.5) script that generates an interactive matplotlib graph showing population growth. Includes sliders for growth rate, initial population, and carrying capacity.
